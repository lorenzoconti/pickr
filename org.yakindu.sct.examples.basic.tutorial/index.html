    <h1>Basic Tutorial - Light Switch Example Series</h1>

    <p>
    In this example series we will develop a lamp control from scratch. Starting from a simple On/Off switch, we will add further features like brightness adjustment and motion detection step-by-step while introducing new statechart elements with each iteration. In that way you will learn how to use:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>States</strong> and <strong>transitions</strong></li>
    <li>Transition <strong>triggers</strong>, <strong>guards</strong>, and <strong>actions</strong></li>
    <li>Statechart <strong>interfaces</strong>, and where to declare events, variables and operations</li>
    <li><strong>Composite states</strong>, and how they help structuring your statechart</li>
    <li><strong>History states</strong>, and the difference between shallow and deep history</li>
    </ul>
    
    This example is a good starting point to dive into YAKINDU Statechart Tools headfirst.</p>

      <h2>The First Iteration: A Simple Switch</h2>

      <p>
        This is the most basic way to model a light switch. When the <em>operate</em>
        event is raised, the light switch changes back and forth between the <strong>On</strong>
        and <strong>Off</strong> states.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img class="small"
          alt="Basic light switch without any fancy features"
          src="images/01_light_switch.png" />
      </p>

      <p>
        The statechart can be simulated in YAKINDU Statechart Tools, but since
        the <em>operate</em> event is declared as <em>internal</em> it cannot be
        raised from any external client code.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>The Second Iteration: Introducing Interfaces</h2>

      <p>
        A statechart is accesible from the outside, i.&nbsp;e. from client code,
        via <em>interfaces</em>. This light switch version has an interface
        named <em>user</em>, and this interface provides the <em>user.operate</em>
        event to the outside so that it can be raised externally. Events
        declared as <em>internal</em> interface can – nomen est omen – only be
        used internally. YAKINDU SCT does not generate any methods to interact
        with internal objects except for the state machine itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img class="small"
          alt="Second iteration, introducing interfaces"
          src="images/02_light_switch.png" />
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>The Third Iteration: Introducing Variables</h2>

      <p>
        While the classic theory of <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_automaton">input/output
          automata</a> is only aware of events, <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram#Harel_statechart">Harel
          statecharts</a> and YAKINDU SCT have many more features, including
        variables.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using variables, we can model a <strong>dimmer</strong>. The idea is to
        maintain the brightness of the lamp in a variable named <em>brightness</em>.
        Changing this variable's value corresponds to changing the lamp's
        brightness. Each time the state machine activates the <strong>Off</strong>
        state, the <em>brightness</em> variable is explicitly set to 0 in the <strong>Off</strong>
        state's entry actions.
      </p>

      <p>For this purpose, our assumed light switch no longer has only a
        single switch to turn the light on and off. Now it has two buttons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The "on" button turns on the light and, upon repeated
            pushing, turn the brightness higher until the latter's maximum is
            reached.</p></li>
        <li><p>The "off" button turns off the light.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <img alt="Third iteration, introducing variables"
          src="images/03_light_switch.png" />
      </p>

      <p>
        When the user operates the "on" button for the first time, i.&nbsp;e.
        the <em>user.on_button</em> event is raised, the light is turned on at
        its lowest brightness level of 1. The state machine triggers the
        transition leading from the <strong>Off</strong> state to the <strong>On</strong>
        state. This transition has an action
        <code>user.brightness = 1</code>
        to set the brightness to 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the <strong>On</strong> state is active, each further push on the
        "on" button resp. each further raising of the <em>user.on_button</em>
        event, triggers the transition leading from the <strong>On</strong>
        state to itself. The brightness is incremented by 1 up to a value of 10.
        The guard condition
        <code>[user.brightness &lt; 10]</code>
        inhibits execution of the transition if the brightness is 10 (or
        greater, but that cannot happen).
      </p>

      <p>
        Operating the <strong>Off</strong> button switches off the light. The
        dimmer will not remember the last brightness level and will restart with
        a brightness of 1 when the "on" button is pushed again.
      </p>

      <p>The example shows how to manipulate a variable by an action as well
        how to use it in a guard condition in transitions.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>The Fourth Iteration: Introducing Composite States</h2>

      <p>
        Let's enhance our light switch by a <strong>motion sensor</strong>.
        Initially, the light is off, but whenever the motion sensor senses a
        motion, it turns the light on. After 30 seconds without any motion the
        light is turned off again.
      </p>

      <p>Operating the light switch manually overrides this behaviour at any
        time. When the user pushes the "on" button, the light's brightness is
        increased by 1, effectively turning the light on if it was off and
        turning it one step brighter if it was on already. In this mode the
        light switch behaves just like the dimmer described in the previous
        section. If the user pushes the "off" button the light switch changes
        back to motion sensing mode.</p>

      <p>
        The sensor is modeled by an additional <em>sensor</em> interface. It has
        a single event named <em>motion</em> event. The sensor raises this event
        when it detects a motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        For modeling the behavior of the light switch with a motion sensor, <em>composite
          states</em> come in handy, another important feature of YAKINDU SCT. A
        composite state is a state that contains one or more other states
        (substates). One of the advantages is the possibility to group states
        into logical compounds and thus make the statechart more comprehensible.
      </p>

      <p>Another advantage is the option to exit a composite state by
        transitions that have the composite state as their source states, not
        any substate. If such a transition is executed, the composite state is
        left regardless of which of its substates are active at the moment. You
        could achieve the same without composite states, but it would be
        cumbersome since you would need a transition from each of the plain
        states in the group to the "outside".</p>

      <p>
        In the model depicted below, the initial state defines the <strong>MotionSensing</strong>
        composite state as the first active state. This composite state has its
        own initial state, pointing to the <strong>Off</strong> state. A signal
        from the motion sensor, i.&nbsp;e. raising the <em>sensor.motion</em>
        event, transitions to the <strong>On</strong> state and sets the
        brightness to 1 via the <strong>On</strong> state's entry action.
        Subsequent <em>sensor.motion</em> events keep the state machine in the <strong>On</strong>
        state. After 30 seconds without any signal from the motion sensor the
        execution flow transitions to the <strong>Off</strong> state and the
        light is turned off again.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the user pushes the "on" button, the state machine transitions from
        the <strong>MotionSensing</strong> composite state to the <strong>Manual</strong>
        state, regardless of whether the active substate of <strong>MotionSensing</strong>
        was <strong>Off</strong> or <strong>On</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Manual</strong> state's entry action increases the
        brightness by one, so that the light is turned on when the source state
        was <strong>Off</strong> and turned one step brighter if the source
        state was <strong>On</strong>. The entry action is also executed each
        time the <em>user.on_button</em> event is raised, until the brightness
        reaches its maximum. The <em>user.off_button</em> returns to the <strong>MotionSensing</strong>
        mode and turns the light off.
      </p>

      <h2>The Fifth Iteration: History States</h2>

      <p>
        This example clarifies how history states work, what they do, and
        especially what they don't do. To illustrate this, we introduce another
        mode to our light switch: <strong>twilight / luminosity control</strong>.
        When operating in twilight mode, the light switch automatically turns on
        the light when it is dark and turns it off when it is bright. For this
        purpose we introduce a <em>luminosity sensor</em>. It permanently senses
        the ambient brightness and fires <em>lum_sensor.bright</em> or <em>lum_sensor.dark</em>
        events all the time. It is out of scope how "dark" and "bright" are
        defined and how they are configured in the luminosity sensor. Suffice to
        say that the sensor is always raising events – say, multiple times per
        second – and that each event is either <em>lum_sensor.bright</em> or <em>lum_sensor.dark</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The light switch is either operated manually or operates automatically.
        When in automatic mode, the light switch functions either as a twilight
        switch as explained above or as a montion sense switch, see the previous
        section. The user interface gets another button to toggle between the
        two modes via the <em>user.mode_button</em> event. We should have added
        a third automatic mode where the light switch doesn't do anything but
        simply turning the light of. However, for brevity we left that out resp.
        as an exercise to the reader.
      </p>

      <p>The light switch is starting to change into a full light control
        module. Its statechart now looks like this:</p>

      <p>
        <img class="standard-image"
          alt="Fifth iteration, including history states"
          src="images/05_light_switch.png" />
      </p>

      <p>
        The automatic modes are grouped into the <strong>Automatic</strong>
        composite state. That state is subdivided into a composite state for the
        twilight functionality and another one for motion sensing. We have
        discussed motion sensing before, but the <strong>Twilight</strong>
        composite state deserves some explanation. When the ambient brightness
        is changing from day to night or from night to day, the luminosity
        sensor doesn't deliver consistent values. Rather small fluctuations are
        causing a succession of quickly alternating <em>lum_sensor.dark</em> and
        <em>lum_sensor.bright</em> events. Having each of these events turn the
        light on or off, respectively, would result in a flickering lamp for
        some time during twilight. To avoid this, the state machine requires a
        certain permanence in the luminosity sensor's results before actually
        toggling the light's state.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is done like this: During the day the <strong>Twilight</strong>
        composite state's <strong>Off</strong> substate is active. In this state
        the state machine listens for <em>lum_sensor.dark</em> events. These
        events are starting to be raised when it is about to get dark. First
        they come in spuriously, later there are more <em>lum_sensor.dark</em>
        than <em>lum_sensor.bright</em> events within a given period of time,
        until only <em>lum_sensor.dark</em> events are raised. The first <em>lum_sensor.dark</em>
        changes the state from <strong>Off</strong> to <strong>Dark_waiting</strong>.
        In this state we are waiting until a certain time has passed, e.&nbsp;g.
        10 seconds, to be configured as constant <em>lum_sensor.wait_time</em>.
        However, each <em>lum_sensor.bright</em> event brings the state machine
        back to the <strong>Off</strong>. Only if the waiting time has passed
        without any <em>lum_sensor.bright</em> interfering, the <strong>On</strong>
        state is reached and the light is turned on. The analogous happens in
        the morning when the first light of the day is close. The twilight
        switch is also robust against short disruptions like overshadowing the
        sensor during the day or illuminating it briefly by a car's headlamps
        during the night.
      </p>

      <p>
        An important requirement is that any of the automatic modes can be
        interrupted at any time by manually operating the light switch via <em>user.on_button</em>.
        When the user later raises a <em>user.off_button</em> event, the state
        machine should return to that particular substate somewhere down in the
        <strong>Automatic</strong> composite state that was active before the
        manual intervention. Similarly, when toggling between <strong>Twilight</strong>
        and <strong>MotionSensing</strong>, the state machine should remember
        the respective active substate and return there when control is turned
        back.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's what <strong>history states</strong> are good for. The statechart
        contains three <em>shallow history states</em>. There is one in <strong>Twilight</strong>,
        one in <strong>MotionSensing</strong>, and one in the <strong>Automatic</strong>
        composite state the former two are nested in.
      </p>

      <p>A shallow history state, contained in a composite state with a set
        of possible states inside that composite state, remembers which of these
        states was active when that composite state was left.</p>

      <p>
        The shallow history state in <strong>Automatic</strong> remembers
        whether <strong>Twilight</strong> or <strong>MotionSensing</strong> was
        active when <strong>Automatic</strong> was left, but it doesn't remember
        which state was active within the active one of these two. On re-entry,
        the history state would activate either <strong>Twilight</strong> or <strong>MotionSensing</strong>,
        but these would start on their respective entry states. This is why
        there is a history state in each of them as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have worked with history states before, you might be inclined now
        to say: "A <em>deep</em> history state would have been the correct thing
        here." However, you would only be partially right. A deep history state
        remembers the active state in its own region and everything that was
        active inside of this state, recursively down to the lowest level. We
        might spare the two shallow history states in <strong>Twilight</strong>
        and <strong>MotionSensing</strong>. But it would not behave in the same
        way – a history state is activated only when its containing region is
        actually left. Using one deep history state would not allow to remember
        the active state in <strong>MotionSensing</strong> when switching to <strong>Twilight</strong>,
        and vice versa. The deep history state would be activated only if we
        left the whole <strong>Automatic</strong> composite state – and when
        switching between automatic modes we are not going to do that.
      </p>
      
      <p>
         More information on history states can also be found in the <a href="../examples/org-yakindu-sct-examples-basic-historystates?exampleId=org.yakindu.sct.examples.historystates">History States</a> example or 
         the corresponding <a href="https://www.itemis.com/en/yakindu/state-machine/documentation/user-guide/sclang_graphical_elements#sclang_shallow_history_states">chapter</a> in our documentation.

    <div>
      <h2>The Sixth And Last Iteration: Introducing Operations</h2>

      <p>This is the final version of the light switch, which has become a
        light computer. This version adds a presence simulation, which means it
        behaves as if a person operated the light at sensible and irregular
        intervals although nobody is present. The motion detection and the
        twilight detection are left out for clarity.</p>

      <p>The presence simulation is active on certain hours of the day only,
        namely from 17:00 to midnight and from 06:00 to 10:00.</p>

      <p>
        To implement this functionality, we are finally hitting the limits of
        the statechart language. It neither provides a function returning random
        values nor one to get the current date and time. However, YAKINDU SCT
        allows you to implement your own <em>operations</em> to overcome these
        limitations. An operation is called from the state machine itself, so
        you don't have to care about when and how they will be called. You can
        receive arguments from the state machine and return a value, exactly
        like a normal function or method call.
      </p>

      <p>
        <img class="standard-image"
          alt="Sixth iteration, introducing operations"
          src="images/06_light_switch.png" />
      </p>

      <p>We use this feature here to do two things:
      <ol>
        <li>Ask for the current time of day to decide if we should actually
          engage the Presence simulation (using the <em>every</em>-keyword
          inside of the declaration)
        </li>
        <li>Ask for a random float to produce a random waiting interval in
          minutes between WAIT_MIN and WAIT_MAX. Every 60 seconds, the waiting
          time is decreased by one. This happens in an orthogonal state to
          showcase the different available possibilities to do periodic tasks.
          Everytime wait_minutes reaches a value of 0, which means the waiting
          time is over, the <em>waitOver</em>-event is raised (<em>raise</em>-keyword)
          which makes the light switch between the <strong>On</strong> and <strong>Off</strong>
          states. On this occasion a new waiting time is calculated by calling <em>get_rand()</em>
          as well.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Furthermore, we make use of three <em>orthogonal states</em>, which you
        can see inside of the state <strong>Wait</strong>. The reason for this
        is that these three states are then executed virtually in parallel
        (their order is relevant, though). This way, we can have three tiny
        statecharts that count down every 60 seconds, check if a new waiting
        time needs to be calculated and if the light's state needs to be
        switched (the two latter ones happen at the same time, but the
        functionality is different). The other features of the light switch from
        earlier iterations are stripped away here to keep the statechart
        comprehensible.
